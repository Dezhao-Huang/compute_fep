<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>lj/cut/soft</I> style and substyles compute the 12/6
Lennard-Jones and Coulomb potential modified by a soft core, in order
to avoid singularities during free energy calculations when sites are
created or anihilated <A HREF = "#Beutler">(Beutler)</A>,
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/pair_lj_soft.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>Coulomb interactions are damped at short distance,
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/pair_coul_soft.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>In the Coulomb part C is an energy-conversion constant, qi and qj are
the charges on the 2 atoms, and epsilon is the dielectric constant
which can be set by the <A HREF = "dielectric.html">dielectric</A> command.
</P>
<P>The parameter lambda is an activation parameter. When lambda = 1 the
pair potentiel is identical to a Lennard-Jones term plus a Coulomb
term. When lambda = 0 the pair interactions are deactivated. The
transition between these two extrema is smoothed by a repulsive soft
core in order to avoid singularities in potential energy and forces
when sites are created or anihilated and can overlap
<A HREF = "#Beutler">(Beutler)</A>. The remaining coefficients can have fixed
values: n = 2, alpha_LJ = 0.5 and alpha_C = 10 Angstrom^2 is an
appropriate choice.
</P>
<P>The <I>lj/cut/tip4p/long/soft</I> implements a soft-core version of the
TIP4P water model. Its usage is documented in the
<A HREF = "pair_lj.html">pair_lj</A> styles. The soft-core version adds the lambda
parameter to the list of arguments, after epsilon and sigma in the
<A HREF = "pair_coeff.html">pair_coeff</A> command.
</P>
<P>The <I>coul/cut/soft</I>, <I>coul/long/soft</I> and <I>tip4p/long/soft</I> substyles
are designed to be combined with other pair potentials via the
<A HREF = "pair_hybrid.html">pair_style hybrid/overlay</A> command.  This is because
they have no repulsive core.  Hence, if used by themselves, there will
be no repulsion to keep two oppositely charged particles from
overlapping each other. In this case, if lambda = 1, a singularity may
occur.  These substyles are suitable to represent charges embedded in
the Lennard-Jones radius of another site (for example hydrogen atoms
in several water models).
</P>
<P>For the <I>lj/cut/coul/cut/soft</I> or <I>lj/cut/coul/long/soft</I> pair styles,
the following coefficients must be defined for each pair of atoms
types via the <A HREF = "pair_coeff.html">pair_coeff</A> command as in the examples
above, or in the data file or restart files read by the
<A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> or <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A>
commands, or by mixing as described below:
</P>
<UL><LI>epsilon (energy units)
<LI>sigma (distance units)
<LI>lambda (activation parameter between 0 and 1)
<LI>cutoff1 (distance units)
<LI>cutoff2 (distance units) 
</UL>
<P>Note that sigma is defined in the LJ formula as the zero-crossing
distance for the potential, not as the energy minimum at 2^(1/6)
sigma.
</P>
<P>The latter 2 coefficients are optional.  If not specified, the global
LJ and Coulombic cutoffs specified in the pair_style command are used.
If only one cutoff is specified, it is used as the cutoff for both LJ
and Coulombic interactions for this type pair.  If both coefficients
are specified, they are used as the LJ and Coulombic cutoffs for this
type pair.  You cannot specify 2 cutoffs for style <I>lj/cut/soft</I>,
since it has no Coulombic terms. For the <I>coul/cut/soft</I> and
<I>coul/long/soft</I> only lambda and the optional cutoff2 are to be
specified.
</P>
<P>The following coefficients have fixed values: n = 2, alpha_LJ = 0.5,
alpha_C = 10 Angstrom^2 <A HREF = "#Beutler">(Beutler)</A>. To change these
recompilation is required.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Mixing, shift, tail correction, restart info</B>:
</P>
<P>For atom type pairs I,J and I != J, the epsilon and sigma coefficients
and cutoff distance for this pair style can be mixed.
The default mix value is <I>geometric</I>.  See the "pair_modify" command
for details.
</P>
<P>These pair styles support the <A HREF = "pair_modify.html">pair_modify</A> shift
option for the energy of the Lennard-Jones portion of the pair
interaction.
</P>
<P>These pair styles support the <A HREF = "pair_modify.html">pair_modify</A> tail
option for adding a long-range tail correction to the energy and
pressure for the Lennard-Jones portion of the pair interaction.
</P>
<P>These pair styles write information to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do not need
to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>To avoid division by zero do not set sigma = 0. When sites do not
interact though the Lennard-Jones term use epsilon = 0 and sigma = 1
for example, or else use the <I>coul/cut/soft</I> substyle.
