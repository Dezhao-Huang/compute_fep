pair_style lj/soft/coul/sorft command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style style args :pre

style = {lj/soft/coul/soft}
args = list of arguments for a particular style :ul
  {lj/soft/coul/soft} args = cutoff
    cutoff = global cutoff for Lennard Jones interactions (distance units)
  {lj/soft/coul/soft} args = cutoff (cutoff2)
    cutoff = global cutoff for LJ (and Coulombic if only 1 arg) (distance units)
    cutoff2 = global cutoff for Coulombic (optional) (distance units)
:pre

[Examples:]

pair_style lj/soft/coul/soft 10.0
pair_style lj/soft/coul/soft 10.0 10.0
pair_coeff * * 0.28 3.1 1.0
pair_coeff 1 1 0.28 3.1 1.0
pair_coeff 1 1 0.28 3.1 0.0 10.0
pair_coeff 1 1 0.28 3.1 1.5 10.0 10.0 :pre


[Description:]

The {lj/soft/coul/soft} styles compute the 12/6 Lennard-Jones
potential modified by a soft core, in order to avoid simgularities
during free energy calculations when sites are created or anihilated
"(Beutler)"_#Beutler,

and a Coulomb term damped at short distance, given by

:c,image(Eqs/pair_coul_soft.jpg)

in the Coulomb part C is an energy-conversion constant, qi and qj are
the charges on the 2 atoms, and epsilon is the dielectric constant
which can be set by the "dielectric"_dielectric.html command.  If one
cutoff is specified in the pair_style command, it is used for both the
LJ and Coulombic terms.  If two cutoffs are specified, they are used
as cutoffs for the LJ and Coulombic terms respectively.

The parameter lambda is an activation parameter. When lambda = 1 the
pair potentiel is identical to a Lennard-Jones term plus a Coulomb
term. When lambda = 0 the pair interactions are null. The transition
is smoothed by a repulsive soft core in order to avoid singularities
during alchemical transformations when sites are created or
anihilated"(Beutler)"_#Beutler.

For the {lj/soft/coul/soft} pair style, the following coefficients must
be defined for each pair of atoms types via the
"pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command as in the examples above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands, or by mixing as
described below:

epsilon (energy units)
sigma (distance units)
lambda (activation parameter between 0 and 1)
cutoff1 (distance units)
cutoff2 (distance units) :ul

Note that sigma is defined in the LJ formula as the zero-crossing
distance for the potential, not as the energy minimum at 2^(1/6)
sigma.

The latter 2 coefficients are optional.  If not specified, the global
LJ and Coulombic cutoffs specified in the pair_style command are used.
If only one cutoff is specified, it is used as the cutoff for both LJ
and Coulombic interactions for this type pair.  If both coefficients
are specified, they are used as the LJ and Coulombic cutoffs for this
type pair.  You cannot specify 2 cutoffs for style {lj/cut}, since it
has no Coulombic terms.

The following coefficients have fixed values: n = 2, alpha_LJ = 0.5,
alpha_C = 4 Angstrom^2 "(Beutler)"_#Beutler. To change these
recompilation is required.

[Mixing, shift, tail correction, restart info]:

For atom type pairs I,J and I != J, the epsilon and sigma coefficients
and cutoff distance for this pair style can be mixed.
The default mix value is {geometric}.  See the "pair_modify" command
for details.

The {lj/soft/coul/soft} pair style supports the
"pair_modify"_pair_modify.html shift option for the energy of the
Lennard-Jones portion of the pair interaction.

The {lj/soft/coul/soft} pair style supports the
"pair_modify"_pair_modify.html tail option for adding a long-range
tail correction to the energy and pressure for the Lennard-Jones
portion of the pair interaction.

The {lj/soft/coul/soft} pair style writes information to "binary
restart files"_restart.html, so pair_style and pair_coeff commands do
not need to be specified in an input script that reads a restart file.
