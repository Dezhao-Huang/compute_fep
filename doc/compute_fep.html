<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Free-energy perturbation (FEP) method. Apply a perturbation to one or
more parameters of the interaction potential and recalculate the pair
potential energy without changing the atomic coordinates from those of
the reference, unperturbed system. The potential energy of the system
is decomposed in three terms: a background term corresponding to
interaction sites whose parameters remain constant during the run, a
reference term U_0 corresponding to the initial interactions of the
atoms that will undergo perturbation, and a perturbed term U_1
corresponding to the final interactions of those atoms:

<P>A coupling parameter "lambda" connects the reference and perturbed
systems by varying from 0 to 1, such that
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/compute_fep_lambda.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>It is possible but not necessary that the coupling parameter (or a
function thereof) appears as a multiplication factor of the potential
energy:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/compute_fep_linear.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>Therefore, the compute fep can perform perturbations to interaction
parameters that are not directly proportional to the potential energy
(e.g. sigma in Lennard-Jones potentials).
</P>
<P>This command can be combined with <A HREF = "fix_adapt.html">fix adapt</A> to
perform multistage free-energy perturbation calculations along
stepwise alchemical transformations during a simulation run:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/compute_fep_fep.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>By choosing a very small perturbation "delta" the compute fep can be
used to implement the thermodynamic integration method by evaluating
the derivative of the potential energy with respect to "lambda" using
a numerical 2-point formula:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/compute_fep_ti.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>where w_i are weights of a numerical quadrature. The <A HREF = "fix_adapt.html">fix
adapt</A> command can be used to define the stages of
"lambda" at which the derivative is calculated and averaged.
</P>
<P>The finite-difference thermodynamic integration (FDTI) method
<A HREF = "#Mezei">(Mezei)</A> is another possibility combining thermodynamic
integration with an evaluation of the numerical derivative of the free
energy by free-energy perturbation using a small "delta":
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/compute_fep_fdti.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>Concerning the choice of how the atomic parameters are perturbed in
order to setup an alchemical transformation route, several strategies
are available, such as single-topology or double-topology strategies
<A HREF = "#Pearlman">(Pearlman)</A>.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTES: This compute command does not take kinetic energy
into account, therefore the masses of the particles should not be
modified between the reference and perturbed states, or along the
alchemical transformation route.  This compute command does not change
bond lengths or other internal coordinates, although this may not be
an issue in many applications <A HREF = "#Karplus">(Karplus)</A>.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>pair</I> attribute enables various parameters of potentials defined
by the <A HREF = "pair_style.html">pair_style</A> and <A HREF = "pair_coeff.html">pair_coeff</A>
commands to be changed, if the pair style supports it.
</P>
<P>The <I>pstyle</I> argument is the name of the pair style. For example,
<I>pstyle</I> could be specified as "lj/cut".  The <I>pparam</I> argument is the
name of the parameter to change.  This is a (non-exclusive) list of
pair styles and parameters that can be used with this compute.  See
the doc pages for individual pair styles and their energy formulas for
the meaning of these parameters:
</P>
<DIV ALIGN=center><TABLE  BORDER=1 >
<TR><TD ><A HREF = "pair_born.html">born</A></TD><TD > a,b,c</TD><TD > type pairs</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ><A HREF = "pair_buck.html">buck</A></TD><TD > a,c</TD><TD > type pairs</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ><A HREF = "pair_lj.html">lj/cut</A></TD><TD > epsilon,sigma</TD><TD > type pairs 
</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>

<P>Note that it is easy to add new potentials and their parameters to
this list.  All it typically takes is adding an extract() method to
the pair_*.cpp file associated with the potential.
</P>
<P>Similar to the <A HREF = "pair_coeff.html">pair_coeff</A> command, I and J can be
specified in one of two ways.  Explicit numeric values can be used for
each, as in the 1st example above.  I <= J is required.  LAMMPS sets
the coefficients for the symmetric J,I interaction to the same
values. A wild-card asterisk can be used in place of or in conjunction
with the I,J arguments to set the coefficients for multiple pairs of
atom types.  This takes the form "*" or "*n" or "n*" or "m*n".  If N =
the number of atom types, then an asterisk with no numeric values
means all types from 1 to N.  A leading asterisk means all types from
1 to n (inclusive).  A trailing asterisk means all types from n to N
(inclusive).  A middle asterisk means all types from m to n
(inclusive).  Note that only type pairs with I <= J are considered; if
asterisks imply type pairs where J < I, they are ignored.
</P>
<P>If <A HREF = "pair_hybrid.html">pair_style hybrid or hybrid/overlay</A> is being
used, then the <I>pstyle</I> will be a sub-style name.  You must specify
I,J arguments that correspond to type pair values defined (via the
<A HREF = "pair_coeff.html">pair_coeff</A> command) for that sub-style.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>atom</I> attribute enables atom properties to be changed.  The
<I>aparam</I> argument is the name of the parameter to change.  This is the
current list of atom parameters that can be used with this compute:
</P>
<UL><LI>charge = charge on particle 
</UL>
<HR>

<P>The <I>tail</I> keyword controls the calculation of the tail correction to
"van der Waals" pair energies beyond the cutoff, if this has been
activated via the <A HREF = "pair_modify.html">pair_modify</A> command. If the
perturbation is small, the tail contribution to the energy difference
between the reference and perturbed systems should be negligible.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute calculates a global vector of length 3 which contains the
energy difference (U_1 - U_0) as c_ID[1], the Boltzmann factor
exp(-(U_1 - U_0) / kT) as c_ID[2] as and the volume of the
simulation box V as c_ID[3]. U_1 is the pair potential energy
obtained with the perturbed parameters and U_0 is the pair potential
energy obtained with the unperturbed parameters.
</P>
<P>If the keyword <I>volume</I> = <I>yes</I>, then the Boltzmann factor is
multiplied by the volume so that correct ensemble averaging can be
performed over trajectories in which the volume fluctuates <A HREF = "#AllenTildesley">(Allen and
Tildesley)</A>.
</P>
<P>These results can be used by any command that uses a global scalar or
vector from a compute as input.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">Section_howto
15</A> for an overview of LAMMPS output
options. For example, the computed values can be averaged using <A HREF = "fix_ave_time.html">fix
ave/time</A> to calculate the free-energy differences.
</P>
<P>The values calculated by this compute are "extensive".

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>

<P>This compute is part of the MISC package.  It is only enabled if LAMMPS
was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
