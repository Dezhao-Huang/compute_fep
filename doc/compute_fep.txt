compute fep command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID fep temp attribute args ... keyword value ... :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command :ulb,l
fep = name of this compute command :l
temp = external temperature (as specified for constant-temperature run) :l
one or more attribute with args may be appended :l
attribute = {pair} :l
  {pair} args = pstyle pparam I J delta
    pstyle = pair style name, e.g. lj/cut
    pparam = parameter to perturb
    I,J = type pair(s) to set parameter for
    delta = perturbation to apply (in the units of the parameter)
  {atom} args = aparam I delta
    aparam = parameter to adapt over time
    I = type to set parameter for
    delta = perturbation to apply (in the units of the parameter) :pre
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {tail} :l
  {tail} value = {no} or {yes}
    {no} = ignore tail correction to pair energies (usually small in fep)
    {yes} = include tail correction to pair energies :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

compute 1 all fep 298 pair lj/cut epsilon 1 * 0.001 pair lj/cut sigma 1 * 0.001
compute 1 all fep 300 atom charge 2 0.001 :pre


[Description:]

Free-energy perturbation method. Apply a perturbation to one or more
parameters of the interaction potential and recalculate the pair
potential energy without changing the atomic coordinates from those of
the reference, unperturbed system.

This command can be combined with "fix adapt"_fix_adapt.html to
perform free-energy calculations along gradual alchemical
transformations during a simulation run. Several strategies are
available for the setup of an alchemical transformation route, such as
the single-topology or the double-topology strategies
"(Pearlman)"_#Pearlman. This compute can also be used to implement the
finite-difference thermodynamic integration (FDTI) method
"(Mezei)"_#Mezei. Note that this compute command does not change bond
lengths or other internal coordinates, although this may not be an
issue in many applications "(Karplus)"_#Karplus.

The {pair} attribute enables various parameters of potentials defined
by the "pair_style"_pair_style.html and "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html
commands to be changed, if the pair style supports it.

The {pstyle} argument is the name of the pair style. For example,
{pstyle} could be specified as "lj/cut".  The {pparam} argument is the
name of the parameter to change.  This is a (non-exclusive) list of
pair styles and parameters that can be used with this compute.  See
the doc pages for individual pair styles and their energy formulas for
the meaning of these parameters:

"born"_pair_born.html: a,b,c: type pairs:
"buck"_pair_buck.html: a,c: type pairs:
"lj/cut"_pair_lj.html: epsilon,sigma: type pairs :tb(c=3,s=:)

IMPORTANT NOTE: It is easy to add new potentials and their parameters
to this list.  All it typically takes is adding an extract() method to
the pair_*.cpp file associated with the potential.

Similar to the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command, I and J can be
specified in one of two ways.  Explicit numeric values can be used for
each, as in the 1st example above.  I <= J is required.  LAMMPS sets
the coefficients for the symmetric J,I interaction to the same
values. A wild-card asterisk can be used in place of or in conjunction
with the I,J arguments to set the coefficients for multiple pairs of
atom types.  This takes the form "*" or "*n" or "n*" or "m*n".  If N =
the number of atom types, then an asterisk with no numeric values
means all types from 1 to N.  A leading asterisk means all types from
1 to n (inclusive).  A trailing asterisk means all types from n to N
(inclusive).  A middle asterisk means all types from m to n
(inclusive).  Note that only type pairs with I <= J are considered; if
asterisks imply type pairs where J < I, they are ignored.

IMPROTANT NOTE: If "pair_style hybrid or
hybrid/overlay"_pair_hybrid.html is being used, then the {pstyle} will
be a sub-style name.  You must specify I,J arguments that correspond
to type pair values defined (via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html
command) for that sub-style.

:line

The {atom} attribute enables atom properties to be changed.  The
{aparam} argument is the name of the parameter to change.  This is the
current list of atom parameters that can be used with this compute:

charge = charge on particle :ul

:line

The {tail} keyword controls the calculation of the tail correction to
"van der Waals" pair energies beyond the cutoff, if this has been
activated via the "pair_modify"_pair_modify.html command. If the
perturbation is small, the tail contribution to the energy difference
between the reference and perturbed systems should be negligible.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a global scalar which is:

exp(-(U_1 - U_0) / kT)

and also a global vector of length 2 containing the pair energy
difference (and also the Boltzmann factor):

U_1 - U_0

where U_1 is the pair potential energy obtained with the perturbed
parameters (using the site coordinates of the present configuration of
the system) and U_0 is the pair potential energy obtained with the
unperturbed parameters.  The Boltzmann factor scalar can be accessed
as c_ID (or c_ID\[2\]) and the energy difference as c_ID\[1\]. These
results can be used by any command that uses a global scalar or vector
from a compute as input.  See "Section_howto
15"_Section_howto.html#howto_15 for an overview of LAMMPS output
options. For example, the computed values can be averaged using "fix
ave/time"_fix_ave_time.html to calculate the free-energy differences:

-kT ln < exp(-(U_1 - U_0) / kT) >_0

The values calculated by this compute are "extensive".


[Restrictions:]

This compute is part of the MISC package.  It is only enabled if LAMMPS
was built with that package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#start_3 section for more info.

[Related commands:]

"fix adapt"_fix_adapt.html, "fix ave/time"_fix_ave_time.html

[Default:]

The option defaults are tail = no.
